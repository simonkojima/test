Brewfile manager for `Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`_ at OS X.

It is similar to
`homebrew-bundle <https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle>`_
command,
but brew-file has more abilities:

- Automatic Brewfile update at install/uninstall.
- Brewfile management with GitHub repository.
- Different file forms: bundle form, shell script form, brew-file form (simple version of script form).
- etc...
